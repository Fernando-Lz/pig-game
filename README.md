# Pig Game

Third project of a series of three to learn the basics of **DOM manipulation**.

- First project: [Guess my number](https://github.com/Fernando-Lz/guess-my-number)
- Second project: [Modals](https://github.com/Fernando-Lz/modals)

## How to play:
1. The first player to reach a score of 100 wins
2. Click the button 'ROLL DICE' to roll the dice
3. The number you rolled will be added to your current score and you will keep rolling until you roll a '1'
4. If you roll a '1' you will lose all your score and the next player will roll now
5. You can hold you score clicking the button 'HOLD' and will saved it and the next player will roll
6. Greed is key, but you need to measure it

## Functionalities reviewed:
- Selecting and manipulating elements
- Handling click events
- Manipulating CSS Styles
